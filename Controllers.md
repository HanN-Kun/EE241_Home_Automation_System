## Controllers

### Overview
The controller acts as the central unit or "brain" of the home automation system. It processes data from sensors, makes decisions based on pre-defined
rules or algorithms, and sends commands to actuators to perform specific actions.

### Common Types of Controllers
- **Microcontrollers (e.g., Arduino):** Suitable for simple automation tasks. Can be used for basic control and data processing.
- **Single-board Computers (e.g., Raspberry Pi):** More powerful than microcontrollers, capable of running full operating systems and performing complex tasks such as data logging,
   machine learning, and web-based control.
- **Dedicated Smart Home Hubs (e.g., SmartThings, Hubitat):** Designed specifically for home automation, integrating various communication protocols and providing user-friendly interfaces.

### Requirements and Specifications
- **Processing Power:** Must be sufficient to handle multiple sensor inputs and actuator outputs in real-time.
- **Connectivity:** Should support communication protocols used in the system (e.g., Wi-Fi, Zigbee, Z-Wave).
- **Scalability:** Capable of handling additional devices as the system expands.
