## Security and Data Protection

### Overview
Security measures are critical in home automation to protect the system from unauthorized access and to ensure user data is safe.

### Key Security Features
- **Encryption:** Data should be encrypted during transmission to prevent eavesdropping.
- **Authentication:** Devices and users should be authenticated before accessing the system.
- **Access Control:** Different access levels can be set for various users (e.g., owner vs. guest).
- **Firewall and Antivirus:** Implement network security measures to protect against cyber threats.

### Requirements and Specifications
- **Encryption Standards:** Use strong encryption algorithms such as AES-256.
- **User Authentication:** Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA).
- **Regular Updates:** Devices should be capable of receiving firmware updates to address security vulnerabilities.
