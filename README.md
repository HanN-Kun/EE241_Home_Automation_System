# EE241_Home_Automation_System_

  #Second assigment of this project is about writting the verilog description for our home automation system.Now let me introduce our home automation
  system.Our automation is abaout security of our home system includes various sensor.list of sensor types goes on like window sensor,door sensor ,motion 
  sensor ,temperature sensor,water leak sensor,glass brake sensor and we also have a alarm button in case of emergency sutiation.Our purpose is clear first
  adjust this system on our basys3 card and then we may also adapt our system to mobile app.
  
  #Verilog descripton has a property.We want that our system give us signal so that we could know that what emergency is we are facing off so we use fault 
  command in our verilog system fault help us to detect which sensor give the input that creates emergency.Purpose of this property through the basys3 card 
  led's.Our code also includes a testbench so that we may see conclusions of our code.
