## Communication Protocols

### Overview
Communication protocols are the methods used for data exchange between the various components of the home automation system, such as controllers, sensors, and actuators.

### Common Protocols
- **Wi-Fi:** Provides high-speed data transfer and is suitable for devices that require constant connectivity, such as smart cameras.
- **Zigbee:** Low-power, mesh-network protocol that is suitable for sensors and low-data-rate devices.
- **Bluetooth:** Ideal for short-range communication, often used in wearable devices and local control.
- **MQTT:** A lightweight messaging protocol suitable for low-bandwidth environments. Commonly used in IoT systems for device communication.

### Requirements and Specifications
- **Range:** Should cover the entire area where the system operates.
- **Power Consumption:** Low-power protocols are preferred for battery-operated devices.
- **Interference Resistance:** Must perform well even in environments with many other devices.
